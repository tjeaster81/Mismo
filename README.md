# Mismo Messaging System
The Mismo Messaging System is a complete Email hosting package, written for NodeJS, that comprises
three modules: (a) the SMTP Engine, (b) the qProcessor, and (c) the front-end load-balancer.

Additionally, a webmail client, will be developed to access emails stored in the
Mismo Messaging System (i.e., via MongoDB ODM instead of POP3/IMAP).  The only requirement of the
webmail application is that it be written in PHP.
